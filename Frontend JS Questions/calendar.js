// Design a weekly calendar view
// Page shows seven columns, one for each day of week
// It shows events which are provided through an API endpoint
// It will have left and right to go to next and prev weeeks. On clicking today, should go to current week

// Events may begin at any time. Not hourly or half hourly
// Multiple events may be scheduled in same time slot, in which case event blocks would be side by side
// Do this using only Plain  js, html and css
